Why this extension ?
----------------------
You may know that another extension with the same goal exists (ngopengraph).
However the implementation is different on a few points :
- jcopengraph is based on an datatype that you can add at each class
- this datatype allows dynamic changes for each classes and even content object (by overriding class values)
- as working with attributes, an attribute_view_gui will provide tag generation that will be send
  to pagelayout using the persistent variable (through ezpagedata_set)
- this means that this extension avoid any unneeded node fetch at the pagelayout level (this is the main
  difference with ngopengraph, at least the main one regarding best practices).
- 99% of the configuration is done class by class directly in the administration interface
- almost no ini configuration
